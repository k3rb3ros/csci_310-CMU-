# LINQ #
########

LINQ is a feature in C# that uses keywords that directly map to valid Server query code (often SQL but not neccesarily) 

3 typical datasources

**Generics** A generic data table that you populate yourself

**XML** 

**Databases**

A LINQ query operation consists of three distinct actions:
	1. Obtain the data source.

	2. Create the query. 

	3. Execute the query.

In order for LINQ to work your data source has to be Queryable and Enermerable 

When pulling data from a database it is important to make your query as specific as possible to minimize the amount of unnecesary data transmited over the network and enabling you to parse less data.

The mathmatical cross product of two tables is the same as joining them together.
